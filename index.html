      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>My name is Casey Paul and I am a first year grad student studying Information Science. I'm not sure how much more of
        <br>a description of myself I want to give in case <em>creepy</em> people find this. Maybe I listen to too many true crime podcasts
        <br>and overthink this stuff. &#129335;&#127996;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039;</p>
        
      <h3>What are my interests?</h3>
      <p>My hobbies and interests are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Sports photography</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Hanging out with my friends</li>
      </ul>
        <br>My favorite show is Survivor, and my favorite movies are the Night at the Museum movies.</p>
      <h3>What are my goals?</h3>
      <p>If sports photography allowed, my goal would be to be a sports photographer for a D1 university or professional sports team.
        <br> Since this type of photography is paid the least, my goal is to be a UX designer/researcher. I have worked for the Identity Lab
        <br>with Jed Brubaker since my sophomore year of college and have loved all the projects I have helped with.</p>
      <h3>What do I do?</h3>
      <p>My current project is my master's thesis where I am trying to understand the bereaved's preferences of online platforms<br>
        and social media account of their deceased loved ones. I have conducted five workshops so far and plan on
        <br>conducting two more in the near future.</p>
